# logzio-azure-serverless
This repo contains the code and instructions you'll need to ship logs from your Azure services to Logz.io.
At the end of this process, your Azure function will forward logs from an Azure Event Hub to your Logz.io account.

## Before you start

To get everything up and running, you'll need to have these things ready before you start:

You'll need:
* An Event Hub that will receive logs
  ([instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/))
* Logs streaming from your Azure services to the Event Hub
  ([instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs))

In step 1 of the setup, you'll need the Event Hub name, resource group, and region—so keep this information handy!

## Setting log shipping from Azure

### 1. Create a new Azure function app

**Note**: If you need more help setting up a function app, see [Azure Functions Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) from Microsoft.

In the left menu of the Azure Portal, click **Create a resource**, then select **Compute > Function App**.
Click **Create** (bottom of the panel) to continue to the _Function App_ panel.

Use these settings (set the other values to whatever makes sense for your environment):
* **Resource Group**: Click **Use existing**, and then choose the resource group that contains the Event Hub you'll collect logs from
* **Runtime Stack**: Choose **JavaScript**
* **Location**: Choose the same region as the Event Hub you'll collect logs from

Click **Create** to deploy the new function app. This may take a few minutes.

Wait until the deployment is complete to continue.

### 2. Create a new function in the function app

In the left menu, click **Resource groups**, then click the resource group that you just deployed to.

Click the function app you just deployed.
In the function app's left menu, click **+** (next to **Functions**) to add a new function.
This takes you to the Quickstart tab.

Click **In-portal**, and then click **Continue**.

Click **More templates...**, and then click **Finish and view templates** to continue.

![Event Hub Trigger](img/event-hub-trigger.png)

In the search box, type "event hub", and then click **Azure Event Hub Trigger**.
The _New Function_ panel opens.

Above the **Event Hub connection** list, click **new**.
In the _Connection_ dialog box, select the **Event Hub** tab, then set the options for the Event Hub you'll collect logs from.
Click **Select** to return to the _New Function_ panel.

Leave the other form fields as their default values, and then click **Create**.

### 2. Add code to the function

In the _index.js_ window, replace the default code with the [Logz.io function code](lib/index.js).

Replace `<ACCOUNT-TOKEN>` with the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) of the account you want to ship to.

Replace `<LISTENER-URL>` with your region's listener URL. If your login URL is app.logz.io, use `listener.logz.io`. If your login URL is app-eu.logz.io, use `listener-eu.logz.io`.

Click **Save**.

### 3. Install logzio-nodejs

In the bottom of the window, click **Console** to show the command line, then update npm to the latest version and install logzio-nodejs:

```pwsh
npm i -g npm
npm install logzio-nodejs
```

The logzio-nodejs installation may take a few minutes.
You can confirm the installation started by clicking **View files** (on the right side of the window) and finding _node_modules > logzio-nodejs_.

### 4. Test your configuration

In the right of the window, click **Test** to show the test panel, and then click **Run**.
If you experience any errors in Azure, it may be that the logzio-nodejs installation isn't complete yet.
If you need more information on dependency management, please see [Azure Functions JavaScript developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node#dependency-management) from Microsoft.

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open Kibana.
If everything went according to plan, you should see logs with the type `eventhub` in Kibana.

If you still don’t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html) in the Logz.io docs.
